-Runnable files: problem1_1.zpl, problem1_2.zpl, problem1_3.zpl, problem1_4_solution1.zpl, problem1_4_solution2.zpl

-problem1_1.zpl, problem1_2.zpl, and problem1_3.zpl solve the 1st 2nd and 3rd sudoku's in homework problem1.

-Problem1_4_solution1.zpl reads sudoku4.dat, which is a "bad sudoku" (sparse) that I created.
-The solution for problem1_4_solution1.zpl is stored in sudoku4_solution1.dat.

-To determine if there are other solutions for problem1_4_solution1.zpl, I created problem1_4_solution2.zpl, which is very similar to problem1_4_solution1.zpl. In addition to the original "bad sudoku" problem, I hard coded and added a constraint that prevents problem1_4_solution2.zpl to have x[i,j, solution1[i,j]] be 1. Thus,  problem1_4_solution2.zpl needs to generate a different solution.

-Written answers to problem2 to problem7 are in pdf “problem2-7”.

-MATLAB codes are hand written.
